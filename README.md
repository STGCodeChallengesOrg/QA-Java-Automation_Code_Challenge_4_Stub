Write a method to return the time each ski resort is from the Airport.

Go to https://www.skiutah.com/

click on the link that is on the home page to compare resorts.

The method should be able to return a time based on the name of the ski resort that I want to pass in.  You can return the value either w/ a string or int.

The sample code stub is found in the WebPageTest.java file.
